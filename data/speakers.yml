    Developers are increasingly adopting tools like React, Vue, and Angular to develop their front-ends. These tools are powerful alternatives to the dark days of jQuery, however, they are orders of magnitude more complex. Companies like GitHub and Basecamp are speaking out against this complexity. They are utilizing tools and techniques that leverage server-side technologies while delivering smooth UIs that feel like SPAs. In this talk, we’ll explore some compelling strategies to deliver more value and write less JavaScript!
