											Developers are increasingly adopting tools like React, Vue, and Angular to develop their front-ends. These tools are powerful alternatives to the dark days of jQuery, however, they are orders of magnitude more complex. Companies like GitHub and Basecamp are speaking out against this complexity. They are utilizing tools and techniques that leverage server-side technologies while delivering smooth UIs that feel like SPAs. In this talk, we’ll explore some compelling strategies to deliver more value and write less JavaScript!

										<div class="description">
											Chargebacks are an unavoidable burden for anyone accepting credit card payments online. Not only are chargebacks costly, but left unchecked you'll find yourself without a way to accept payments. What's the source of these chargebacks? Unsatisfied customers? Credit card fraud? And who's this Canadian spending thousands of dollars from Morocco? In this talk, I'll share real-world experiences combating chargebacks and credit card fraud in a SaaS application.

One of the more mystifying and unexpected pain points of running an online business is a "chargeback." Unless you've previously dealt with them, you may not even know what they are. That was the case I found myself in when co-founding a SaaS platform. This talk leverages our experiences to inform entrepreneurs and developers on how to respond and mitigate chargebacks. I'll include how we identified patterns (like our Canadian friend who seems to be on a spending spree in Morocco), implemented a workflow and adopted tools to help reduce the burden of chargebacks.

											As IoT devices and platforms proliferate, the challenging reality of sensor technology and the nature of physical systems become the bottleneck to getting a product into the market. Over the past two years SynaTree has worked with local Industrial Tech company PSNergy to develop a real-time IoT system for industrial use, and we've learned a lot along the way.  This talk will share some of the insight we've gained into how to build a system from the ground up, and some of the ways in which we've failed.  We'll also discuss which technologies have worked the best for us, in detail.

											You thought security and identity management was boring? In this "Choose Your Own Adventure" style talk, the attendees are in control of the talk. By using a simple web application, the attendees will be able to decide how deep they want to go on topics like OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWTs. Want to see the examples in Python? How about JavaScript? Cast in your vote to pick the language you want to see. Will this talk focus more on front-end or back-end? Attend the talk to decide which one you want to see in this unique presentation. By the end of this talk, the attendees will understand how to use JWTs with OAuth and OIDC to build more secure applications.

									<h3 class="title">Intro to Web Assembly</h3>
										<div class="description">
											Want to write a web application? Better get familiar with JavaScript! JavaScript has long been the king of front-end. While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and you still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.

I'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.

When we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let's and get started!
